# Export-Time-Series-from-Netcdf-with-shapefile
Here, we export a time series from a NetCDF using the boundaries of a shapefile. 
The inputs are the NetCDF files and the shapefile. 

This script accumulates the hourly data on a daily scale.
Also, it calculates at different time scales, such as monthly, annual, and Normal Climate. 
Later, these data are saved in different CSV files.
