# Export-Time-Series-from-Netcdf-with-shapefile
Here, we export a time series from a NetCDF using the boundaries of a shapefile. 
The inputs are: 
- The NetCDF files
- The shapefile

This script accumulates the hourly data on a daily scale.
Also, it calculates at different time scales, such as:
- Monthly
- Annual
- Normal Climate.

Later, these data are saved in different CSV files.
